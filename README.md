# JavaEmployeeWages
Learning the Java language and practice using inheritance, arrayLists, classes and loops.

I created a program that creates a base class of Employee and child class of Salaried Employee and Hourly Employee. From 
these classes you can calculate how much money they would earn each week before and after state and federal tax withholdings
based on what their wage is and how many hours they worked or based on their salary.

Used IntelliJ Community for my IDE, and used the ArrayList Library in Java.
